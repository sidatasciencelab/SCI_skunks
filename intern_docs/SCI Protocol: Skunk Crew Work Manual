# Introduction
The Island Spotted Skunk Monitoring Project is a collaborative project between the Smithsonian Data Science Lab and the UCSB Office of Education Partnerships. This manual outlines the steps Skunk Crew members should follow to ensure an efficient workflow, from the pre-trip preparations to final data submission.

## Pre-Trip Preparations
### Coordinators' Communication
- Review the email from coordinators containing essential trip details, including dates, information packets, packing lists, and itineraries.
### Print List Review
- Check the print list on Trello and GitHub for necessary prints.
- Print and compile required documents for the trip (OEP prints for free).
- Update protocols as needed (e.g., update datasheet if a camera was replaced last trip).
### Food and Gear Preparation
- Collect and store food in designated bins and boxes.
- Pack necessary gear into boxes for transportation.
### Task Assignments
- Create a task list splitting up responsibilities amongst participants, such as transporting supplies, checking in with IPCO (Boat to Santa Cruz Island), weighing items, and loading IPCO.

## On-Site Tasks
### Ventura Harbor Pier
- Arrival and completion of designated tasks at the pier.
### Prisoners Bay, Santa Cruz Island
- Unloading items and transportation to the field site.
### Field Site Preparation
- Organize rooms and store food and gear accordingly.

## Field Data Collection
### Camera Trap Setup
- Prepare the skunk box and folder with necessary items for fieldwork tasks. See Skunk Box and Folder Checklist.
- Follow detailed steps for collecting data at camera trap sites, replacing batteries, and documenting field notes and metadata on data sheets.

## Data Processing
- Process collected SD cards using the mass rename script and machine learning model script.
- Generate CSV files from both scripts and compile relevant field notes and metadata from the data sheets for each camera trap site - they will be used in Post-Trip Procedures: Data Management.
### Inventory Update
- Update inventory lists based on field requirements before leaving the island.

## Post-Trip Procedures
### Return to UCSB
- Transportation of equipment, food, and secure data back to UCSB.
### Data Management
- Store metadata sheets and data safely.
- Compilation and organization of CSV files using tabular manipulation and binding, including mass rename script results, model outcomes, and field notes (from CSV file that will be created and manually filled in for metadata datasheet field notes and camera set notes).
### Data Submission
- Format CSV files to Camtrap DP standards.
- Store CSV files and images on a hard drive.
- Send data to the Smithsonian's Hydra computer using Globus from the hard drive.
- Upload metadata sheets and standardized CSV files to GitHub.
- Take a picture of metadata sheets and upload to GitHub or somewhere else safe.
- Store metadata datasheets and hard drive somewhere safe.

# Conclusion
The completion of these steps ensures the efficient collection, processing, and submission of data for the Island Spotted Skunk Monitoring Project.

### 0.1 System Configuration

**Description**

The following text documents the actions I performed while navigating the system configuration. 

**L4T_End_User_License_Agreement:**

Select "I accept the terms of these licenses"

**Language:**

Select "English"" 

**Where are you?:**

Select "Los Angeles""

**Who are you?:**

Your Name: UCSBOEP
Your computer's name: ucsboep-desktop
Pick a username: ucsboep 
Password: diffusion.1846

**Help improve ubuntu: Would you like to send this information:**

Select "Yes, send system info to Canonical""

### 0.2. Required Materials

To ensure your NVIDIA machine functions properly, you'll need the following materials and accessories:

1. **WiFi Adapter**
Attach the WiFi Adapter to your NVIDIA Machine. It is called "TP-Link AC600 USB WiFi Adapter for PC". After you've attached it you should see a WiFi icon in the upper right corner. Please be sure to look for the WiFi you'd like to connect to and enter its password. 

2. **Monitor**
Use the HM Tech Display for Raspberry Pi. It should come with a stand and power cord. 

3. **Power Cord for the Monitor with USB-A Port**
The monitor requires power to function. You can connect the monitor to an outlet using the provided power cord with a USB-A port.

4. **HDMI to HDMI Cord**
To establish a video connection between your machine and the monitor, use an HDMI to HDMI cord. Connect one end to your device and the other end to the monitor's HDMI port.

5. **Logitech Wireless Keyboard**
Use a Logitech wireless keyboard. Connect the wireless USB A port to your machine to pair it. 

6. **Power Cord with USB-C Port**
Connect your machine to a power source using the provided power cord with a USB-C port. Ensure the power cord is plugged into the correct port, there are two USB-C ports, one for data and one for power. 

7. **SD Card and SD Card Reader with USB-A Port**
An SD card and an SD card reader are useful for data storage and transfer. Insert the SD card into the reader and connect the reader to a USB-A port on your machine.

These materials are essential for setting up and using your NVIDIA machine!


## 1. USB Port C Observations <a name="observations"></a>

### 1.1 USB-C Port Doesn't Read SD Cards


**Description:**

I've observed that the USB-C port on my machine is not functioning as expected when it comes to reading SD cards. When I insert an SD card into the USB-C port; I notice it's not recognized by the system. This issue has been consistent across multiple SD cards I've tested.

**Potential Causes:**

1. **Driver Issue:** There might be a missing or outdated driver for the USB-C port, causing it to not properly communicate with SD cards.

2. **Physical Connection:** There could be a loose or damaged connection within the USB-C port that is affecting its ability to read SD cards.

**Troubleshooting Steps Taken:**

1. I've tested the same SD cards in other ports (e.g., USB-A) on my machine, and they are being recognized without any issues.

2. I've mounted and unmounted it several times through the command line and physically

3. I've used commands 'lsblk' and  'fdisk -l' to see if it is detected. It was not detected. 

**Next Steps:**


1. I'll consider reaching out to technical support for further assistance.
